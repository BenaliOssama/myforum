**About This Project**  
This is an open-source forum project inspired by the book *Let's Go* by Alex Edwards (2022). The project aims to provide learners and developers with a hands-on experience in building a fully functional web application using Go (Golang).  

**Why This Project?**  
By following the principles and techniques outlined in the book, this project serves as both a practical implementation and a collaborative learning platform. It is a great opportunity for learners to:  
- Explore best practices in web development with Go.  
- Understand the underlying concepts of building a robust and scalable forum.  
- Collaborate and contribute to open-source development.  

**How You Can Help**  
- **Review**: Share feedback on the design, code structure, or any part of the application.  
- **Contribute**: Submit pull requests for improvements, new features, or bug fixes.  
- **Learn Together**: Whether youâ€™re a beginner or an experienced developer, join the journey and help foster a collaborative learning environment.  

Let's work together to make this project a great resource for the Go community and beyond!
